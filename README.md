## Travel around the world! 

*Have you dreamed about travling around the world?*  
*How many countries have you been to? Do you want to create you own map to record these countries?*  
*Do you have a bucket list for your future travelling?*  

**I am your personal travelling robo-agant!**  

I remember your travel records and your bucket list for future travelling.  
Using a world map as background, I will show national flags in:  
- **semi-transparent** for the countries in your bucket list  
- **opaque** for the countries you have been to  

**Just remember to update me after each travel!**

This project tracks travel history intend to build a world map illustrates the travel history and travel plan.  
Any travellers can use this to create their own unique map of travelling.  
I am interested in this project because I want to travel around the world and I want a map unique to myself!

### Phase 1  

- As a user, I want to be able to add a country name to my travel bucket list.  
- As a user, I want to be able to view my travel bucket list.  
- As a user, I want to update my travel record after I completed my trip.  
	- This means add the country to the completed list, and remove the country from bucket list.  
- As a user, I want to be able to see the number of countries in my bucket list and completed list.
