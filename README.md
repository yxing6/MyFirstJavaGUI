**Welcome to my first Java Project**

This GUI application allow users to track their travel records and update their bucket list!  

This project was developed with the help from the entire instruction team of CPSC 210 at UBC and consisted of four phases:
1. Model construction and commend line user interaction
2. Data persistence 
3. Graphical User Interface 
4. Design decision   

Code were tested during the implementation, and all changes are committed regularly.   
I tried my best writing this program; however, I also acknowledge that the final GUI is lengthy and inefficient.   
There are plenty room for improvement. Stay tuned for major upgrade on version 2!
