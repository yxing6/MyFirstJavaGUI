## Travel around the world! 

*Have you dreamed about traveling around the world?*  
*How many countries have you been to? Do you have a bucket list for your future travelling?*  

**Your personal travelling robo-agent is here to help!**  

I remember your travel records and your bucket list for future travelling.  
I help you to track the cost spent on past travels and money you need to save for future travels.  


**Tell me your wishes and remember to notify me after each travel! Let's go~**

This project tracks travel history and potentially builds a world map to illustrate the travel history and travel plan.  
Any travellers can use this to track their budgets.  
I am interested in this project because I want to travel around the world!

### Phase 1  

- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple countries to my travel list.  
- As a user, I want to be able to view my travel bucket list.  
- As a user, I want to update my travel record after I completed my trip.  
    - This means add the country to the completed list, and remove the country from bucket list.  
- As a user, I want to be able to see the number of countries in my bucket list and completed list.  
- As a user, I want to know how much money I have spent on travelling.
